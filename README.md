# Welcome to Expressive RDF Mapper (XRM) repository

This is the main code repository for the XRM project.

The XRM editor allows you to write data mappings to RDF in a friendly domain specific language (DSL) and generates output in
[R2RML](http://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/), [RML](https://rml.io/specs/rml/), [CARML](https://github.com/carml/carml) and [CSV on the Web](https://w3c.github.io/csvw/primer/) format.


## Installation and usage

For further information, including installation and usage instructions of XRM, see the user-oriented [expressive-rdf-mapper](https://github.com/zazuko/expressive-rdf-mapper) repository.
